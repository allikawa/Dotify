# Dotify - Homework 3
### INFO 448
### Alli Hishikawa

This is a proof of concept for a music playing app called Dotify.
The app first opens up to a list of songs. A user can click on a song, allowing the name and artist of the song to show up at a fixed tab at the bottom of the screen. Long pressing on one of the songs will delete the song from the list and initiate a short popup message notifying users which song they have deleted. A shuffle button at the bottom right of the screen shuffles the songs. Clicking on the song in the mini player launches a new activity, showing a song player with an album cover, song name, artist name, and a play button. On this view, a user can change their username, press the play button to increment the play counter, and press the skip buttons for a short popup message.

For this assignment, I wasn't able to achieve all the requirements in the homework, so am just submitting what I have working.

Below are screenshots of my app running in an emulator:
